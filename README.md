This mobile app is a collection of resources for retired people. The app connects retired people to local activites and allowes them to reserve their space for their chosen activity. It will offer directions, timings, and any contact information. This app is styled for mobile and tablet screens. **_It is a work in progress_**.

## The Challenge
