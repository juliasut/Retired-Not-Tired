This mobile app is a collection of resources for retired people. The app connects retired people to local activites and allowes them to reserve their space for their chosen activity. It will offer directions, timings, and any contact information. This app is styled for mobile and tablet screens. **_It is a work in progress_**.

## The Challenge

Build and style a functioning app from scratch within a two week timeline while working on a small team of three new devs in three different timezones. Our goal is to help resolve a chosen social issue by implementing ideas in this app. Our mission is to help senior, retired, or early retired people stay active socially, stay in touch, and maintain their quality of life.
